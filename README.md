Market Basket Analysis with ML

Overview
This project explores Market Basket Analysis using machine learning techniques. This is a data
mining approach used to identify patterns within a customer's shopping cart and helping
businesses understand which products are frequently purchased together.

Project Description
Market Basket Analysis is a valuable technique to understand customer behaviour and
optimizing marketing strategies. This project implements machine learning algorithms such as
Apriori, association rule mining to find frequent itemsets and generate meaningful insights for
businesses.

Key Features
-> Utilizes machine learning algorithms to identify associations between products.
-> Provides actionable insights to improve product placement, promotions, and
recommendations.
->  Supports customizable thresholds and parameters for association rule mining.
->  Generates visualizations for better data understanding.

Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
->  Python 3.x or more version
->  Requires Python libraries (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, etc.)

You can use your own dataset for market basket analysis. Ensure that your dataset is in CSV or a
compatible format. Modify the data.csv file or update the script to load your dataset.

Data Preprocessing
->  Data cleaning and transformation: Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format with
columns representing transactions or baskets.
->  Handle missing values if necessary.
->  Encode categorical data (e.g., one-hot encoding).
Machine Learning Models

This project uses the following machine learning models and algorithms :
->  Apriori Algorithm: A classic algorithm for frequent itemset generation.
->  Association Rule Mining: Use predefined metrics (support, confidence, lift) to extract
meaningful associations.

Results
The project generates association rules and insights into product associations based on your
dataset. Visualizations and summary statistics are available for better understanding.
